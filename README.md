# Small County Roleplay #

Welcome to the Small County Roleplay development hub!

Today I've decided to release my samp gamemode as I have no intention of starting my server (I've lost most of my interest in SAMP). This gamemode has been sitting on my hard-drive for like half a year, in that time I haven't kept up with anything samp related soooo yeah, there may be a few issues. 
This is a unique script, but it is by no means finished, so whoever picks this up is going to need to do some work! I've made the repository public and so I guess (dependent on how generous I'm feeling) I will fix issues if you point them out on there! I don't think the script is too hard to understand, but IDK. Anyway, without further ado, Small County RP!
